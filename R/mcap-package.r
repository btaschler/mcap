#' Model-based clustering in very high dimensions (especially p >> n) via adaptive projections. 
#' Clustering is based on Gaussian mixture models in a lower dimensional (projected) space.
#' Projection dimension is set adaptively based on a cluster stability criterion.
#' Available projection variants (so far) include PCA and Random Projections.
